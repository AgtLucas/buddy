## Buddy!

### Foreword
In the winter of 2016, I began creating Buddy. Initially Buddy was built to be a friend when working from home, something or someone to talk back at me every now and then, and inject a little humor into my life.

After some time, the ***surprise and delight*** of creating my own bot (if you could even call it that) went missing, and I opened Buddy up to some friends, with the promise that whatever code they write, will be running in my browser.

Its probably best if you watch me talk about him, to really experience what he became all about.

He's a nasty piece of work.

Understandably, there's some really weird code in his actual source, but due to overwhelming want, I'm open sourcing a really (read: really really) simple shell, of Buddy's existance. So people can create and play with their own "Buddy"

### How it works!
